    Content: >
      Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm  a developer and an open-source enthusiast from India. I maintain a blog infrequently where I share things. Feel free to reach out to me there or via email. You can often find me active on Discord and Telegram.
      
      - In my spare time, I enjoy reading, writing and gaming as well. I have also contributed to several open source projects over the past 5 years since I adore open source development.
